# DrStange Calculator

A very basic calculator as your first Android app task. Order of operations is left-to-right. The logic is basically string processing. This calculator incorporates basic operations like addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. But it certainly won’t compare to any of your default mobile calculators or those available on the Google playstore.  
So, in the words of Linus, "Go wild, fork the project, and prove your point. Show everybody that you can make improvements."

## TODO

•	Add more operations like pow(x,y) and use of brackets (time to revisit BODMAS rule ;P)

•	add feature that lets you continue using your answer in a new operation

•	add the coolest feature: shake to clear the screen (i.e. the last operation)

•	add a widget on screen for this app
